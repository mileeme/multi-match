# Boulder Beat Quiz App
Trying to create a quiz to match voters with candidates based on policy not politics.

Next steps:

    1. Get answer selection method working
    2. Figure out how to match to candidate responses.
    3. Probably some other stuff i'm unaware of!
    4. Candidate_detail pages
    5. Some actual css/reasonable looking design
